# iLoveXLSX

## The Goal

Podríamos buscar otro nombre como “XLSX-GO” or smth, y si sale bien, primero intentar promocionarla o algo a ver si pega como producto independiente. Y si no se da, va mail a iLovePDF proponiendo “iLoveXLSX” a ver si nos la toman o algo así.

## The Motivation

“_The global economy is built on two things: the internal combustion engine and Microsoft Excel. Never forget this._” — Kevin Hector

## The Mission

Todo el mundo usa Excel → Muchos no saben su potencial → Ofrecemos soluciones y herramientas

## Base Meta Features

### 👤 User Authentification & Profile Information

Users can register an account, with a unique username and profile picture. Users have their uploaded workbooks saved by the app, in categories corresponding to whichever feature they uploaded them to. Although the posts get deleted for space after either an arbitrary time range (say, 72 hours) or until exceeding an arbitrary boundary (say, 500Mb), the database always stores the IDs of the workbooks uploaded alongside their weights so both user and developers can verify those statistics.

### 💬 Comment Section

Users can leave comments/posts about the app. These can be either ‘bug report’, ‘review’, ‘suggestion’ or ‘other’. **Reviews** come with text & rating; **Bug Reports** come with feature labels and text; **Suggestions** come with Ternary Label (“New Feature", “Feature Improvement”, “Other”) alongside text; and **"Other”** is just plain text.

These comments/posts will have a vote number. They can upvotes/downvoted once by each registered user, like in Reddit or Stack Overflow. Votes \= Upvotes \- Downvotes. They can also be commented on, acting as a thread like Youtube Comments. They can be sorted by Top (upvotes), Most Comments, Most Recent.

## Feature Ideas for xlsx files

### 🔍 Preview XLSX Sheet

Users upload an XLSX file, can open it and preview it, see the contents, the size and such, without needing to be on a computer with Microsoft Excel installed.

### 🔄 XLSX → CSV & XLSX → PDF Conversions

Users upload a .xlsx file, it gets converted to a .csv file. CSV has flexibility and importance in Data Science and easier processing / extraction via scripts. PDF has consistency and importance in presentations & printing.

### 🔀 Merge XLSX Sheets

Users upload several sheets or workbooks, can merge them into a single contiguous one, with user hand on order and placement. Users can also detect tables and group them via indexes, for example, different sheets have a table with “dni” or “book\_id” columns, and can merge them into one or choose join types.

### 🧮 Calculate Numerical Operations

Users upload the sheet, and can select columns or groups of cells to calculate certain operations on. Can be basics such as average, variance, total sum, max, min, mode, etc. Can also be more advanced ones like Correlation, Covariance, Regressions, etc.

### 🧹 Data Clean-Up

Users upload an XLSX file and can quickly tidy it: trim spaces, fix inconsistent text or casing, standardize column types (dates, numbers, text, etc.), remove duplicates, and filter rows. A clean, corrected version is saved without altering the original.
